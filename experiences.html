            This placement involves:<br>

            <br>Providing technical support to any staff member that may need it, this might be repairing / managing software issues - licensing, incorrect download material - Hardware issues - faulty connections, broken parts that I may be able to repair. This involves a large amount of problem diagnosis - by listening to staff descriptions of the error and employing effective problem solving techniques to determine the root of the problem, this might include asking probing questions. Sometimes this can include giving remote support via "Remote desktop Protocol" or RDP for short.</br>
            
            <br>Providing user training to staff that might need it - by this I mean general teaching of how to use a software if the staff member might not understand it as fully as IT do.  I sometimes also help provide security tips to Staff and sometimes students, this is to prevent any attack that might happen on the server.</br>
            
            <br>Asset Auditing - I help keep  track and note down locations and amounts of certain assets - these can be internet access points, their MAC address, location and given name. To help keep the IT department organised for future problems if they may happen. I also help audit printer supplies, for when a printer may run out of ink or have a full drum cartridge.
            
            <br>Ticket Management - I also help resolve tickets sent in by staff - By either fixing the issue (More above) or simply helping write an email back asking a question, or explaining what the fix might be.</br>
